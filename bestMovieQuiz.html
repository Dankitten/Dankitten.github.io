	<h1 style ="color:black;"> Why I love Forrest Gump</h1>
	<p> The story is a wonderful, motivational one that inspires me. It makes me think about what I'm doing with my life.
	And, as mama always said, "Life's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."</p>

	<h1 style ="color:black;"> Favorite Actor </h1>
	<p> Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor and my favorite in this movie. He perfectly captures the kind of person that Forrest should be.</p>
